# KanaQuiz

## A simple python based quiz to study the Japanese alphabet. 
Includes Hiragana, Katakana with dakuten/handakuten and Yōon digraphs.   
Simply run the quiz in python, answer with "quit" to end the program.  
  
Latin characters will match how they are typed in the Japanese Microsoft IME, most of these are obvious and the same as anywhere else however ぢ is answered as "di" and づ as "du". Feel free to edit the CSV to ji/dji/jyi and dzu/zu or however you prefer to write it in latin characters.
